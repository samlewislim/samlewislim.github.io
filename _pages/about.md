I am a PhD student in the Natural Language Processing group at the University of Sheffield, supervised by [Nikos Aletras](https://nikosaletras.com/) and [Cass Zhao](https://casszhao.github.io/cass/). Prior to my PhD, I was a software engineer working in financial tech.

My research focuses on trustworthy reasoning for Large Language Models. I am particularly interested in Chain-of-Thought and explanation faithfulness, and uncertainty quantification for reasoning LLMs.
